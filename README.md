I actually made this game years ago, but that was before I was really into computers and wasn't tracking changes.

This is the new (and hopefully better) version of the game I previously made.

<hr>

I first wrote the basic functionality of the game, and each commit after that added new features/validation.

For example, earlier versions of the game didn't allow repeated digits in the secret number, but later versions allow for repeated digits. This was a bit hard, actually. It took me a while to figure out how to handle repeated digits when counting "cows" and "bulls".
